Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Answer-Software engineering is the process of creation,maintaining and evolution of software programs to fit the end user need.
          Importance
          -  It is essential for digital innovation
          -  It enhances user expirience
          -  It simplifies work
          
          
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-  Change impact analysis
-  Release planning
-  Change implementation


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-  Planning
-  Requirement analysis
-  Design
-  Coding
-  Testing

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a)  Agile is best for dynamic teams that frequently change members throughout the project life cycle, or for teams that assign specific team members to multiple roles.
b)   Waterfall, on the other hand, works best for established teams and where each member is given a specific role.25 Nov 2024


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a)  Software Developer-create the computer applications that allow users to do specific tasks and the underlying systems that run the devices or control networks.
b)   Quality Assurance Engineer- are responsible for ensuring a product is meeting quality requirements before its launch.
c)  Project Manager- Responsible for Identifying project goals and scope. Planning and documenting project tasks. Ensuring deliverables are delivered on-time. 
d)  software engineering team-  is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments - increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application
Version Control Systems- helps manage the source code for the software team by keeping track of all the code modifications


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements
Technological change
System integration
Adapting to new technologies
Limited infrastructure
Tight deadlines
Clearly documenting requirements
Collaboration
Collaborative communication


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI.Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. They help the AI refine the output and present it concisely in the required format.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague:How to describe a shoe?
